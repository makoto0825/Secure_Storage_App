### Database Design

The application uses SQLite as the primary database for Django models and metadata storage:

```sql

-- Custom metadata storage for files
CREATE TABLE file_metadata (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    filename TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    username TEXT,
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP,
    file_size INTEGER,

);
```

### File Storage Implementation

Files are stored in a local directory structure:

```
store/
├── file1.pdf
├── file1.pdf.meta.json
├── file2.docx
├── file2.docx.meta.json
└── ...
```

Each file has an associated metadata JSON file containing:

- Upload timestamp
